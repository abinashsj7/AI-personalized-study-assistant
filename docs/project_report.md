# AI-Powered Personalized Study Assistant

## Problem Statement
Students often rely on generic study methods that fail to address individual learning needs, available time, and topic difficulty. This leads to inefficient learning and increased academic stress.

## SDG Alignment
This project aligns with **SDG 4 – Quality Education** by promoting personalized and inclusive learning support through AI-based recommendations.

## AI Solution Description
The proposed solution is an AI-powered study assistant that collects user inputs such as subject, topic, difficulty level, and available study time, and generates a customized study plan. The system follows an input–process–output workflow to provide meaningful learning guidance.

## Target Users
- College and university students
- Self-learners preparing for exams

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python for application logic
- GitHub for version control and deployment

## Expected Outcomes and Impact
- Improved study efficiency
- Better time management for learners
- Reduced academic stress through structured guidance

## Ethical and Responsible AI Use
- No personal or sensitive data is collected or stored
- The system does not evaluate or grade students
- Recommendations are advisory and non-deterministic
